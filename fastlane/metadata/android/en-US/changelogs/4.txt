Improvements
- Removed all usages of ShimmerHost in favor of dedicated placeholder components for shimmer/loading effects.
- Consistent loading animation: All content types now display 8 placeholders during loading for a unified experience.

Code Structure:
- Common logic extracted: Main page layout, header display, and loading logic are now handled by reusable functions (ItemsPage, ItemsGridPage).
- Placeholders are passed as parameters to these functions to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

Search UI:
- Songs: Loading state now shows 8 SongItemPlaceholder components in a column.
- Albums: Unified shimmer effect using PlaylistItemPlaceholder in both grid and list views.
- Artists: Loading state shows 8 ArtistItemPlaceholder components filling the screen.
- Videos: Displays multiple VideoItemPlaceholder components during loading.
- Playlists, Featured, Podcasts: Use 8 PlaylistItemPlaceholder components for consistent shimmer animation.
- Header is always visible during loading (title, search bar, filters, etc.).
- Fixed unresolved reference errors: playlistItemContentGrid and playlistItemContentList functions are now defined locally per tab.
